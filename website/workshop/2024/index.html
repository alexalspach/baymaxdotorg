									<p><strong>Talk Title: </strong>Interactive Frameworks for Robot Skill Acquisition: Teleoperation and Behavior Authoring</p>

									<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>This talk presents interactive frameworks designed to empower robots in acquiring complex skills, with a focus on teleoperation and behavior authoring. As robots are increasingly deployed in unstructured and dynamic environments, efficiently teaching and refining skills becomes essential. Teleoperation offers an intuitive, hands-on method for demonstrating intricate tasks, allowing robots to directly learn from human expertise. However, challenges persist, such as synchronizing human and robot motion, managing impacts during interaction, and effectively utilizing the robot’s whole body for force generation.</p>
				
									<p>Moving beyond teleoperation, behavior authoring provides operators with tools to define structured, reusable skill sets by decomposing behaviors into low-level action primitives. Using frameworks like behavior trees, this approach builds robust, modular behaviors that enhance adaptability and reusability. I will discuss the integration of these methods, emphasizing how coactive design principles, user interfaces, and real-time feedback mechanisms facilitate precise and efficient behavior authoring.</p>

									<p>We will highlight recent advancements our team has made with these frameworks, demonstrating how they can be leveraged to create more adaptable, effective, and responsive robotic systems for urban exploration.</p>

Lastly, Daniele is the coordinator of the ergoCub project, a 5 million, three year joint project between INAIL and IIT.  Since September 2021, Daniele is the PI leading the  Artificial and Mechanical Intelligence  research line at IIT, a team composed of about forty members that combines AI and Mechanics to devise the next generation of the iCub humanoid robot.</p>

									<p>Concerning awards and recognitions, in 2009 Daniele received the ”Excellence Path Award” from Sapienza for his master studies. In 2019, he was awarded as Innovator of the year Under 35 Europe  from the MIT Technology Review magazine for conceiving the iRonCub, the first jet-powered flying humanoid robot. Since 2020, Daniele is a visiting lecturer at University of Manchester. In July 2020, Daniele was selected to represent Italy at the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI, conceived by Canada and France during their G7 presidencies) for the working group on COVID-19 response. In 2022, Daniele was selected as reviewer of EU projects. Also, in 2022, Daniele was the leader of the iCub team during the ANA Avatar XPRIZE, a four-year 10M$ international competition for making robotic avatars. Starting from 100 initial teams, the iCub team scored 2nd after semifinal, and 14th after finals because of a system failure during day-1 testing; the iCub team scored 1st in the specific category of walking humanoids.</p>

				<h2><strong>Objectives</strong></h2>
				<!--<h2><strong>Call For Contributions</strong></h2>-->

				<p><strong>We are excited to announce our 9th <i>Can we build Baymax?</i> workshop! This year's workshop will be on topics related to robots learning and using new skills.</strong>

				<p>Baymax is a humanoid robot character in the Disney animation “Big Hero 6.” It is a healthcare robot with an inflatable body, capable of walking, bumping into surrounding objects, manipulating, learning new skills, talking, and physically interacting with people. In the movie, students from the Nerd Lab in the fictional San Fransokyo Institute of Technology develop many interesting technologies including Baymax. However, in the real world, it is not easy to build and teach such a robot.</p>

				<p>As a continuation of our previous workshops, this workshop will bring together robotics researchers working on learning human skills. In particular, we will draw attention to efforts in learning from demonstration, teleoperation, motion retargeting, motion/skill/task data collection, foundation models, and scaling, enabling robots to robustly perform real-world tasks and interactions.</p>

				<p>Since our first workshop in 2015, the series has taken place at the <a target="_blank" href="https://2024.ieee-humanoids.org">IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots</a> every year. We invite you to contribute and to participate in this workshop!  baymax.org</p>

						<h2>Christopher G. Atkeson</h2>

						<p>I am a Professor in the Robotics Institute and Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. My life goal is to fulfill the science fiction vision of machines that achieve human levels of competence in perceiving, thinking, and acting. A more narrow technical goal is to understand how to get machines to generate and perceive human behavior. I use two complementary approaches, exploring humanoid robotics and human aware environments. Building humanoid robots tests our understanding of how to generate human-like behavior, and exposes the gaps and failures in current approaches.</p>

						<h2>Joohyung Kim</h2>

						<p>Joohyung Kim is currently an Associate Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. His research focuses on design and control for humanoid robots, systems for motion learning in robot hardware, and safe human-robot interaction. He received BSE and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) from Seoul National University, Korea, in 2001 and 2012. He was a Research Scientist in Disney Research from 2013 to 2019. Prior to joining Disney, he was a postdoctoral fellow in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University for the DARPA Robotics Challenge in 2013. From 2009 to 2012, he was a Research Staff Member in Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Korea, developing biped walking controllers for humanoid robots.</p>
