This workshop has taken place every year since the first in 2015. Baymax is a humanoid character in the Disney feature animation Big Hero 6. It is a healthcare robot with an inflatable body, capable of walking, bumping into surrounding objects, learning motions and physically interacting with people. However, in the real world it is not easy to build such a robot. In the previous workshops, we have discussed topics on mechanisms and structure, sensors, protection, control, and fabrication regarding such special soft robots. As a continuation of this discussion, this workshop will bring together researchers focusing on practical technologies to realize fail-safe systems and tackle challenges in learning for humanoid robots like Baymax. </p>

	        					In this presentation, we will focus on three major areas (Design, Sensing, and Control) where we have made significant improvement for the performance of soft robots like Baymax. In particular we will present how we are optimizing soft robot link configuration to enable large-scale soft walking robots. We will also present on how we have overcome challenges in calibrating sensors and implementing joint sensing for soft robots. In terms of control, we will show three different approaches to improving soft robot control. The first focuses on making the right approximations when linearizing very nonlinear robot models, the second approach relates to learning the nonlinear dynamics and performing control using learned models, and finally we will show how by using parallelization on a GPU, we can perform long time horizon, high bandwidth, model predictive control for soft robots. We will also present initial experiments with the Baxter robot that estimates human intention and responds during a joint manipulation task. This work with a more rigid robot is preliminary to attempting to tie together many of the components of our past work to enable large-scale soft robots to also collaborate effectively with humans.
