				<h2><strong>Objectives</strong></h2>

				<p>This will be the 3rd workshop titled “Can we build Baymax?”. The 1st workshop was held at Humanoids 2015 in Korea and the 2nd one was at Humanoids 2016 in Mexico. Baymax is a humanoid character in the Disney feature animation, “Big Hero 6.” It is a healthcare robot with an inflatable body, capable of walking, bumping into surrounding objects and physically interacting with people. However, in the real world, it is not easy to build such a robot. In the previous workshops, we have discussed topics on mechanisms and structure, sensors, protection, and fabrication regarding such special soft robots. As a continuation of the discussion, this workshop will bring together researchers focusing on practical technologies to realize soft human-robot interaction, and tackle challenges on design and control for soft robots like Baymax to accommodate the unstructured and clustered world. </p>
				<br>
				<p>Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):
					<ul>
						<li>Design of back-drivable and/or torque controllable joint mechanisms</li>
						<li>Design and control of soft actuators</li>
						<li>Safety/softness in physical human-robot interaction</li>
						<li>Contact wrench and position estimation techniques</li>
						<li>Soft human-robot interaction application in wearable and haptic devices</li>

	        					In this presentation, we will focus on three major areas (Design, Sensing, and Control) where we have made significant improvement for the performance of soft robots like Baymax. In particular we will present how we are optimizing soft robot link configuration to enable large-scale soft walking robots. We will also present on how we have overcome challenges in calibrating sensors and implementing joint sensing for soft robots. In terms of control, we will show three different approaches to improving soft robot control. The first focuses on making the right approximations when linearizing very nonlinear robot models, the second approach relates to learning the nonlinear dynamics and performing control using learned models, and finally we will show how by using parallelization on a GPU, we can perform long time horizon, high bandwidth, model predictive control for soft robots. We will also present initial experiments with the Baxter robot that estimates human intention and responds during a joint manipulation task. This work with a more rigid robot is preliminary to attempting to tie together many of the components of our past work to enable large-scale soft robots to also collaborate effectively with humans.
