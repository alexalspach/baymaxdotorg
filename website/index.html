				<h2><strong>Objectives</strong></h2>
				<!--<h2><strong>Call For Contributions</strong></h2>-->

				<p>We are excited to announce our 7th <i>Can we build Baymax?</i> workshop! This workshop will be on topics related to 'Education and Open Source for Humanoid Robots.'</p>

				<p>Since the first workshop was organized in 2015, our workshop series has taken place at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.humanoids2022.org">IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots</a> every year. Baymax is a humanoid character in the Disney feature animation “Big Hero 6.” It is a healthcare robot with an inflatable body, capable of walking, bumping into surrounding objects, learning motions and physically interacting with people. However, in the real world, it is not easy to build such a robot.  As a continuation of the previous workshops, this workshop will bring together researchers looking into education and open source using and enabling humanoid robots. In particular, we will draw attention to humanoid education and deployment of humanoids in education, for example, curriculum and courses for humanoid robotics, education tools for humanoid robotics, robots in education, and open-source software or hardware for humanoids.</p>


				<p>We invite you to contribute and to participate in this workshop.</p>

				<br>
 
				<strong>The workshop's topics include, but are not limited to:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Curriculum and courses for humanoid robotics</li>

					<li>Tools for humanoid robotics education</li>

					<li>Robots in exhibitions, museums, and other public places</li>

					<li>Robots in education (as teachers)</li>

					<li>Open source hardware for humanoid robotics</li>

					<li>Open source software for humanoid robotics</li>

				</ul>

						<h2><strong>Gordon Cheng</strong><br>
						Technical University of Munich</h2>

						<p>Gordon Cheng holds the Chair of Cognitive Systems with regular teaching activities and lectures. He is Founder and Director of Institute for Cognitive Systems, Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Technical University of Munich, Munich/Germany. He is also the coordinator of the CoC for Neuro-Engineering - Center of Competence Neuro-Engineering in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.</p>
						
						<p>Formerly, he was the Head of the Department of Humanoid Robotics and Computational Neuroscience, ATR Computational Neuroscience Laboratories, Kyoto, Japan. He was the Group Leader for the newly initiated JST International Cooperative Research Project (ICORP), Computational Brain. He has also been designated as a Project Leader/Research Expert for National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT) of Japan. He is also involved (as an adviser and as an associated partner) in a number of major European Union Projects.</p>

						<p>Over the past ten years Gordon Cheng has been the co-inventor of approximately 20 patents and is the author of approximately 250 technical publications, proceedings, editorials and book chapters.</p>

						<h2><strong>Dennis Hong</strong><br>
						University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)</h2>

						<p>Dr. Dennis Hong, a TED alumnus, is a Professor and the Founding Director of RoMeLa (Robotics & Mechanisms Laboratory) of the Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering Department at UCLA. His research focuses on robot locomotion and manipulation, autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots. He is the inventor of a number of novel robots and mechanisms, including the ‘whole skin locomotion’ for mobile robots inspired by how amoeba move, a unique three-legged waking robot STriDER, an air-powered robotic hand RAPHaEL, and the world’s first car that can be driven by the blind. His work has been featured on numerous national and international media. Washington Post magazine called Dr. Hong “the Leonardo da Vinci of robots.”</p>

						<p>Dr. Hong has been named to Popular Science’s 8th annual “Brilliant 10”, honoring top scientists younger than 40 years of age from across the United States, “Forward Under 40” by the University of Wisconsin-Madison Alumni Association, and also honored as “Top 40 Under 40” alumni by Purdue University. Hong’s other past awards include the National Science Foundation’s CAREER award, the SAE International’s Ralph R. Teetor Educational Award, and the ASME Freudenstein / GM Young Investigator Award to name a few. Dr. Hong also actively leads student teams for various international robotics and design competitions winning numerous top prizes including the DARPA Urban Challenge where they won third place and the $500,000 prize, and the RoboCup, the international autonomous robot soccer competition where his team won First Place in both the Kid-Size and Adult-Size Humanoid divisions and brought the Louis Vuitton Cup Best Humanoid Award to the United States for the very first time.</p>

						<p>Dr. Hong received his B.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Wisconsin-Madison (1994), his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Mechanical Engineering from Purdue University (1999, 2002).</p>

						<p>He is also a serious gourmet chef and a magician performing annual charity magic shows and lectures on the science of magic.</p>

						<h2><strong>Jerry Pratt</strong><br>
						Institute for Human & Machine Cognition (IHMC)</h2>

						<p>Jerry Pratt (Ph.D., M.Eng., and B.S. degrees from M.I.T. in Computer Science and B.S. degree from M.I.T. in Mechanical Engineering) leads a research group at IHMC that concentrates around the understanding and modeling of human gait and the applications of that understanding in the fields of robotics, human assistive devices, and man-machine interfaces. Current projects include Humanoid Avatar Robots for Co-Exploration of Hazardous Environments, FastRunner Robot, and Exoskeletons for Restoration of Gait in Paralyzed Individuals. Jerry was the team lead for Team IHMC in the DARPA Robotics Challenge (DRC) project. In 2015 IHMC won second place in the DRC finals. In 2013 Team IHMC achieved first place in the Virtual Robotics Challenge and second place in DARPA Robotics Challenge Trials. Before coming to IHMC, Jerry was the President of Yobotics, Inc., a small company that he cofounded in 2000. At Yobotics, Jerry helped develop the RoboKnee, a powered exoskeleton that allowed one to carry large loads while hiking over rough terrain with little effort. Prior to founding Yobotics, Jerry worked at the M.I.T. Leg Laboratory, where he designed, built, and controlled several bipedal robots. His approach of maximizing speed, agility, and biological similarity through the understanding of biological counterparts, is helping to remove the stereotype of robots as being clunky, jerky-moving machines. Jerry’s hobbies include sailing, playing board games, football, basketball, and paintball. Jerry recently founded Boardwalk Robotics, Inc. with the goal to further advance humanoid robots for commercial applications</p>

						<h2>Christopher G. Atkeson</h2>

						<p>I am a Professor in the Robotics Institute and Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. My life goal is to fulfill the science fiction vision of machines that achieve human levels of competence in perceiving, thinking, and acting. A more narrow technical goal is to understand how to get machines to generate and perceive human behavior. I use two complementary approaches, exploring humanoid robotics and human aware environments. Building humanoid robots tests our understanding of how to generate human-like behavior, and exposes the gaps and failures in current approaches.</p>
